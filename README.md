# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
(
1. Analyze wildlife strikes data from 2000-2015 in the United States.
2. Create meaningful visualizations to explore the dataset.
3. Detect trends and patterns related to different categorical features.
) 


## Results
( 
For the project, I chose option 2 and data related to Wildlife Strike from 2000-2015. Tried to understand the data and focussed on answering the questions related to: 
- Forecasting of the strikes 
- Geospatial occurences of the strikes: mapped the data
- Tried to find out the species more vulnerable to these strike
- Cost Analsyis.  
- Detected some outliers as well.
)

## Challenges 
(
- Data Consistency: Inconsistent formats for location information across different records can lead to mapping errors.
- Complex Data: Handling diverse features related to aircraft type, phase of flight, and damage effect in clustering algorithms can be complex
- Outlier Detection: Detecting and handling outliers in the data can impact the quality of analysis and visualizations.
- Numerical and Continuous Data: Ensuring that numerical data, such as cost-related variables, are interpreted correctly is essential.
- Time Constraints: Meeting project deadlines and balancing analysis depth can be challenging.)

## Future Goals
(
- With more time, implement clustering algorithms to identify strike clusters based on aircraft type, phase of flight, and damage effect.
- Explore additional questions related to cost analysis.
- Create a more comprehensive and interactive dashboard for ongoing analysis.
